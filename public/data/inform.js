    "summary": "Hi, I'm front-end developer. For the last two years, I have been studying JavaScript and how to change the way of thinking in general. I chose the React library to learn how to build web applications. Starting from simple components to small pet projects. First of all, i want to learn how to build modern web applications. Get practice writing clean code and be a team player. Secondly, I want to discover more soft skills and find new challenges for myself in a field that is constantly changing and does not stand still.",
